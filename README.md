# Random-Forest
Random Forest and Multiple Linear Regression Models


Comparision of methods in matlab.

Random forest runtimes are quite fast, and they are able to deal with unbalanced and missing data. 
Random Forest weaknesses are that when used for regression they cannot predict beyond the range in the training data, 
and that they may over-fit data sets that are particularly noisy.
Of course, the best test of any algorithm is how well it works upon your own data set.
